<p>Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, <br>
    not you to them or they to you. </p>
<p>I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, <br>
    huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: The End. <br>
    I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, <br>
    at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End. </p>
<p>It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, <br>
    with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, <br>
    and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. </p>
<p>I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that, I wonder. <br>
    I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention <br>
    of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. <br>
    And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, <br>
    and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, <br>
    were the words The End. <br>
    And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have <br>
    written anything, <br>
    and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, <br>
    of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. <br>
    And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: <br>
    the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a <br>
    pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent. </p>
<p>Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by <br>
    organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, <br>
    vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and <br>
    its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, <br>
    the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, <br>
    think about it. </p>

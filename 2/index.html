<p>An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. <br>
    A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. <br>
    Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. <br>
    How a poem acts marks its individual character. <br>
    A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. <br>
    That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; <br>
    the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, <br>
    “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” <br>
    the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, <br>
    Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; <br>
    theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, <br>
    self-consciousness is theatre. </p>
<p>Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, <br>
    a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. <br>
    And the lesson is always the same, <br>
    and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: <br>
    if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, <br>
    at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </p>
<p>I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, <br>
    they will get the wrong idea. </p>
<p>Now here is something really interesting (to me), <br>
    something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million <br>
    three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. <br>
    This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we <br>
    each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence begins with your first words, <br>
    toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, <br>
    or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, <br>
    they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end. </p>
<p>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; <br>
    the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon <br>
    (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) <br>
    you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, <br>
    invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that <br>
    for all apparent purposes is unrelated. </p>
<p>You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, <br>
    the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. <br>
    Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, <br>
    the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other. </p>

<p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings:<br>no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.</p>
<p>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds <br>the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.<br>
    Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, <br>
    which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</p>
<p>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned.<br>
    This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. </p>
<p>Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, <br>
    that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>
    a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>
    and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>
    And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. <br>
    that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. </p>
<p>I believe the poem is an act of the mind. <br>
    I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. <br>
    Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. <br>
    The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, <br>
    somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house. </p>

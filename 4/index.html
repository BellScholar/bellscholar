<p>I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, <br>
    then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word. </p>
<p>The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: <br>
    “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.” </p>
<p>Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, <br>
    usually poetry, usually Dante. <br>
    Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. </p>
<p>Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings). </p>
<p>The poem is the consequence of its origins. <br>
    Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. </p>
<p>Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: <br>
    “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, <br>
    is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, <br>
    and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. <br>
    Or, to use another familiar set of terms, <br>
    an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”</p>
<p>But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. <br>
    How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? <br>
    It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, <br>
    before the universe burst into being, <br>
    but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, <br>
    and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. </p>
<p>I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, <br>
    across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, <br>
    and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. <br>
    Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, <br>
    because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, <br>
    reading these first and last lines, <br>
    that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the <br>
    first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to. <br>
    And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: <br>
    in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear <br>
    as children repeated night after night, like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. <br>
    Go to sleep now. <br>
    And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: <br>
    I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. </p>
<p>But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. <br>
    Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, <br>
    cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, <br>
    and it was finally time to go in. And it was. </p>

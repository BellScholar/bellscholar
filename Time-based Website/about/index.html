            About My Playlist portrays a song that I am listening to and current time with three bars each representing hours, minutes, and seconds. Colors of the bars change as well all the way from red to purple and changes all the way back to red again. The song changes every 4 minutes because that is the average length of each song. The bars also symbolizes the playing bar in music app where it moves from left to right to show the progress of when the song is playing.
